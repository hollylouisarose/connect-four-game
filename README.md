### Side project connect four game, WIP

Connect 4 is a game where players attempt to make a line of four pieces in a 7 x 6 grid. Players can drop their pieces into columns, so that their piece rests in the lowest available space in that column.

The winner is the first to create a line of four in any direction, including diagonally. If the board is filled before a line of 4 can be made, the game is declared a draw.
